# Sound-Classification-using-Mel-Spectrogram-and-CNN

I.	Project Overview:

This project classifies sound signals from different environmental classes in the ESC-10 dataset. the below photo summarizes the model steps:
1.	The model read all the signals of different classes and assign a label number to each class.
2.	The Mel Spectrogram are extracted from the time domain.
3.	Full Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is defined and used to classify 10 different classes of ESC-10 dataset.
